 * Sense as entity
   o fieldable
     - definition
	 - example
	 - relationship
	 - clue
	 - translation
   o gets it's own id
   o Can be related to other things via 'relation' module!
 * Entry as entity
   o comments?
   o divorce it from the node table so we don't worry about number of entries
   o lang, trans and hash can appear on the base table
 * Pron as an entity?
   o Fields: IPA (text field widget, display format?), taxonomy, file
 * Fields as field?
   o Custom widget for multiple values
 * Source as a field_collection

Open questions
==============

 * Javascript keyboard for IPA?
   o http://www.ajaxblender.com/jquery-virtual-keyboard.html
   o http://mottie.github.com/Keyboard/
   o http://drupal.org/project/google_virtual_keyboard

 * Are taxonomy terms connected directly to node? Or can they affect any entity type?

 * Will 'diff' work with any versioned entity?

 * Will we really have to declare so many entity types? Or can we reduce the number somehow?

 * How will 'diff' work with senses in field_collection's?

 * Should lingwo_entry be an entity or node?
   o Can we have comments on custom entities?
     - Not with core!

	 - http://drupal.org/node/731724
   o Can we use MongoDB for the storage?
 
 * Move translations into entity languaeg stuff - rather than tnid?
   - This would drastically reduce the number of nodes, simplify code, etc..
   - http://drupal.org/project/entity_translation
   - Can we show a specific language of a translation even when a different language
     is the current? For example: We're in English mode but we want to see the Polish
	 version of a particular node.
   - Can we write a new content selection plugin? Something that is only URL and 
     not session based?
	 o hook_language_negotiation_info()
	 o Or permalinks on node/%node/translation/%lang which work for both translation and
	   entity_translation!

 * Is "sense" a new entity type? Or just a new bundle on the field collection entity?
   o Are field collections exportable?
   o Can we do our weird translation / language magic to them?
 
 * At what layer do we do our magic? Ie:
   o Translations look different than their sources
   o Languages have different values available to them
 
 * UUID will be in Drupal 8 core. Will nid, et al go away?
